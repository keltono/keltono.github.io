#### this one can be pretty janky, and tends to use pseudo code over actual java code, but the information is very good.

## Offical FIRST sources

[WPILIB "tutorial" by FRC](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java)
#### note: this isn't super helpful as a tutorial, and rather should be used as a reference for spesific problems. slightly outdated.

[WPILIBJ documentation/reference](http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/)

## Video tutorials

#### these are also outdated, but still useful in showing examples and relaying the core things.
